Sometimes interesting things happen. It was about two years ago I worked on a project with Cadence framework and
contributed to [uber/cadence](https://github.com/uber/cadence) open-source project on Github. Today I've received the 
email from Uber Technical Sourcer:

{{< figure src="/img/uber-hello-from-github.png" title="Email from Uber" >}}

I've been inspired by approach how tech companies looking for new team members. Uber itself contributes to open-source 
[a lot](https://github.com/uber) and have sexy libraries.
That's why I like the open-source community. You could always help and contribute to open-source projects as well as get 
something back from community members: feedback, knowledge or opportunities, etc. Itâ€™s awesome. I will definitely continue 
my [open-source journey](https://github.com/vvelikodny)! :heart:

P.S. Uber staff use pretty GIF for email signature, such as:
