Sometimes interesting things happens. It was about two years ago I worked on the project with Cadence and contributed
to [uber/cadence](https://github.com/uber/cadence) open-source project in Github. Today I've got the email from Uber 
Technical Sourcer:

{{< figure src="/img/uber_hello_from_github.png" title="Email from Uber" >}}

That's why I like the open-source community. You always could help and contribute to open-source projects as well as get
something back from community members: feedback, knowledge or even offers, etc. Itâ€™s awesome.
Definitely, continue my open-source journey!

I noticed, Uber staff use cool GIF for email signature, it looks like:
