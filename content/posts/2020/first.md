Sometimes interesting things happens. It was about two years ago when contributed to **uber/cadence** project in Github.
Today I've got the email from Uber Technical Sourcer:

That's why I like the open-source community. You always could help and contribute to open-source projects as well as get
something back from community members: feedbacks, knowledge, offers, etc.
