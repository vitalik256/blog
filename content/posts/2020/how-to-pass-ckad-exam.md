Today I've received email from :

> Congratulations! You have successfully completed Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD). Click the link below to view and download your certificate.

It took me about 1 week to review all thing either I already know or forgot, train different setups on Kubernetes.
Here is my certificate:

This is a complete hands-on proctored exam that tests your knowledge in design, building, configuring, and troubleshooting
cloud-native applications for Kubernetes.

In my opinion, other than having a good understanding of Kubernetes concepts a good understanding and comfortable working
with Linux shells are essential skills to crack this exam.

This exam is definitely recommended if you would like to challenge your Kubernetes skills!
